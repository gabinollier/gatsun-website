# Copilot instructions

Don't add any comments or explanations to the code unless it is necessary.

Follow the code style of the existing code.

Use the same naming conventions as the existing code.

Read all the code you need to understand the codebase and the context.

Try to write the code and organize the files in a way that is consistent with the existing code, that is both easy to unuderstand and, more importantly, future-proof and easy to maintain. You need to code like you are doing an actual application, that will be used in production.
